# Bug Hunters
This is a small hobby project. The idea is that people use an app on their phone to scan NFC tags placed in various places. Each NFC tag represents an insect (Bug), and the goal is to find them all.\
This is the backend for the mobile app.

I have aimed for some version of vertical slice architecture. And when relevant, I have mixed it with a "functional core, imperative shell" approach.
